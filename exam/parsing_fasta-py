# parsing_fasta.py
# For this exercise the pseudo-code is required (in this same file) 
# Write a script that:
# a) Reads sprot_prot.fasta line by line
# b) Copies to a new file ONLY the record(s) that are not from Homo sapiens
# b) And prints their source organism and sequence lenght 
# Use separate functions for the input and the output
